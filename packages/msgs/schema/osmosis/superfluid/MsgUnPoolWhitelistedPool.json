Unpooling takes the locked gamm shares, and runs \"ExitPool\" on it, to get the constituent tokens. e.g. z gamm/pool/1 tokens ExitPools into constituent tokens x uatom, y uosmo. Then it creates a new lock for every constituent token, with the duration associated with the lock. If the lock was unbonding, the new lockup durations should be the time left until unbond completion."
