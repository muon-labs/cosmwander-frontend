Eventually this is intended to be set as the Time-weighted-average-osmo-backing for the entire duration of epoch N-1. (Thereby locking whats in use for epoch N as based on the prior epochs rewards) However for now, this is not the TWAP but instead the spot price at the boundary. For different types of assets in the future, it could change."
